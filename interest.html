    <h2>Running</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 17px">A major hobby I have is running. To me it is an essential way of keeping in shape and staying healthy. I often like to go for a run towards the end of the day after work or college. During a run I do a lot of my thinking and planning which a strange of killing two birds with one stone but in the end I feel that this hobby of mine is here to stay.</p>
    <h2>Soccer</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 17px">The majority of time I have free is spent on soccer. Whether that being through playing it for my local team of 10 years or with my mates to watching it on the tv. This interest led me to a lot of travel as I went to see several matches in person at stadiums such as Stamford bridge in London England or Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid Spain.</p>
    <h2>Travel</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 17px">Travelling is one interest that I cannot live without. Travelling is a way of creating memories and living your life to the best it can be and thatâ€™s why its such an interest of mine. Throughout my time ive been lucky to visit countries like Poland England Spain and Italy with plenty of more to come.</p>
    <h2>Swimming</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 17px">Swimming just like running is an interest of mine due to my determination to stay fit and healthy. I regularly go swimming, usually 3 times a week at the local swimming pool. Swimming is also enjoyed by me on my holidays as nothing can beat a good swim in good weather. </p>
    <h2>Chess</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 17px">Chess is an interest of mine which is one I am proud of. Going All the way back to my primary school days, chess was a key passion of mine. I was the first person ever to win the two chess tournaments in my school, three years in a row. Though as I got older and bigger, sport took over but to this day I still enjoy a good game of chess.</p>
    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 17px">Gaming has always been my interest. I have been an avid gamer from a young age from the times the PlayStation 2 came out. It still is a part of my life as I enjoy to play it after long days at work or college or when the weather prevents doing anything else. Genres such as adventure or campaign games are of most interest to me.</p>
